# CPU and Hardware Accelerators - Lab3

-- remove delta in TB: configure list -delta collapse

## to do:
- The code seems to work overall, need to check why done_FSM is not being toggled. 
(after done_FSM=1 we get the memory write)

- the program gets stuck in instruction 2223 (and ra rb rc)
therefor not proceeding to F000 (done)
