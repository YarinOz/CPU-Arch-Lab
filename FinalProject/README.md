# CPU and Hardware Accelerators - Final Project

-- remove delta in TB: configure list -delta collapse

## notes to do:
1. now working with minimal ALU
2. understand memory interface
3. connect the tri-bus with IO
4. add HW accelerators
5. add FPGA IO conective layer

## notes to keep:
1. in order to init the memory manually use the tb_cache with init (in any other case init=0).
