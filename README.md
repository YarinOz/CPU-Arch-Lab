# CPU and Hardware Accelerators 

This repository contains CPU and HW accelerators modules synthesized in VHDL + stimuli
as part of a Course Lab performed on an Intel's FPGA chip.

## Labs

### Lab 1: VHDL Concurrent Code - ALU

**Lab aims:**
- Develop skills in VHDL, focusing on code structure, data types, operators and attributes, concurrent code, design hierarchy, packages, and components.
- Gain basic skills in ModelSim, a multi-language HDL simulation environment.
- Refresh general knowledge in digital systems and architecture design.

**Tasks:**
1. **System Design ISA**: Implement various arithmetic, shift, and boolean operations based on a predefined instruction set.
2. **Status Bits**: Implement status bits for overflow, zero, carry, and negative conditions.
3. **System Design Micro-Architecture**: Design a module containing an adder/subtractor, shifter, and boolean logic, ensuring it is tested for different `n` values (4, 8, 16, 32).
4. **Generic Adder/Subtractor Module**: Create a generic adder/subtractor using a ripple carry adder.
5. **Shifter Module**: Design a shifter module based on a barrel-shifter without using forbidden operators.
6. **Test and Timing**: Develop a test bench for the system and analyze timing and outputs.
