# CPU-HW-acc

when output not defined -> output is 0 and only zero flag lit
no integers are allowed other then n k m


-- adder and logic unit done. shift reg left

# Questions to Hanan:
1. Do we need to implement the shift register using 2*1 mux, and if not how should we? - no need to use mux , our realization is fine though the carry should only be the last digit being shifted out
