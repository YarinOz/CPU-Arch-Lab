### Lab 5: Pipelined MIPS Architecture - TBA

## Final Project - Single-Cycle Mips CPU

**Aim of the Project:**
- Design, synthesis, and analysis of a single-cycle MIPS CPU core with memory-mapped I/O, interrupt capability, and (optionally) a serial communication peripheral.
- Understand CPU vs. MCU concepts and FPGA memory structure.

**Assignment Definition:**
- The architecture must include a MIPS ISA-compatible CPU with data memory (DTCM) and program memory (ITCM).
- The top-level design and MIPS core must be structural. The design should be compiled and tested on the Altera board using a single clock (CLK).
- Use push-button KEY0 as a system reset.

**I/O Devices Connected:**
- **Input Interface**: Board ten switches (SW9-SW0) and four pushbuttons (KEY3-KEY0).
- **Output Interface**: Board 10 red LEDs (LEDR9-LEDR0) and six 7-segment displays (HEX5-HEX0).

**Required Support of CPU Peripherals:**
1. Seven GPIO ports (six Output and one Input).
2. Three pushbuttons (KEY [3-1]) as input devices.
3. Basic Timer with output compare capability.
4. Unsigned Binary Division Multicycle Accelerator.

**Host Interface (to ITCM and DTCM):**
- Use a JTAG-based code wrapper for communication to memory caches.

**Compiler, Simulator, and Memory:**
- Use MARS or another compiler to compile and simulate assembly code. MARS can also export memory contents in a format readable by VHDL.

**CPU and MCU Test:**
- Support all given test assembly source files.
- Optionally, use serial communication support and write code for a menu transmitted from MCU to PC.
